# LFbackup

Crashplan is getting rid of its "home" plan.  LFbackup will eventually be a replacement.  The basic framework for the backend now exists.  The frontend has not yet been started.  The backend needs more and better plugins, but the existing ones are good for a proof of concept.

Some features are

- choice of compression algorithms
- choice of encryption algorithms
- choice of data store types
- choice of metadata store types
- automatic dedup
